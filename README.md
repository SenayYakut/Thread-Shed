# Thread-Shed

Thread-Shed is a Python project.

Youâ€™ve recently been hired as a cashier at the local sewing hobby shop, Thread Shed. Some of your daily responsibilities involve tallying the number of sales during the day, calculating the total amount of money made, and keeping track of the names of the customers.

Unfortunately, the Thread Shed has an extremely out-dating register system and stores all of the transaction information in one huge unwieldy string called daily_sales.

All day, for each transaction, the name of the customer, amount spent, types of thread purchased, and the date of sale is all recorded in this same string. 

In this project you will use your Python skills to iterate through this string and clean up each transaction and store all the information in easier to access lists.
